# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Express.js to parse JSON request bodies.  The problem occurs when the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON data.  The server fails to correctly handle these situations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js server uses `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON requests.  However, it does not handle cases where the request body is empty or contains malformed JSON. This results in the request body being undefined or an error being thrown, respectively. This can be challenging to debug, especially in production environments.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage empty or invalid JSON requests. By using a try...catch block, we can catch parsing errors and send an appropriate response to the client.  We also add a check for an empty request body to prevent errors.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with an empty body or invalid JSON.
5. Observe the server's response and console output.

## How to Fix

1. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js`.
2. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the fixed server.
3. Repeat step 4 and 5 from the reproduction instructions.
